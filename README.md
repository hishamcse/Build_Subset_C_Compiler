# Build_Subset_C_Compiler
This repository contains a step by step code implementation for the construction of a compiler for a subset of C language

## Step 01_Symbol Table Manager<a name="symbol"></a>
   A symbol-table is a data structure maintained by the compilers in order to store information about the occurrence of various entities such as identifiers, objects,      function names etc. Information of different entities may include type, value, scope etc. At the starting phase of constructing a compiler, we will construct a        symbol-table which maintains a list of hash tables where each hash table contains information of symbols encountered in a scope of the source program
